            <h2>Three Significant Observations</h2>
            <p>There were many comments that were the same among all three users. The elements they could all agree upon were that they enjoyed the background image a lot, it was said that was “colorful”, “draws the eye directly toward the middle”, “good job with the stars”, produced a “good feeling”. The feedback on the background image was so good that I don’t think I will be altering it, as people really liked it. All three users also mentioned the heading gothic font which reads “Daily Day” as being not cohesive with the rest of the project. This I do agree with, although the intention was to create contrast, I don’t think it was received. Users seemed off-put by the font and suggested fonts to better go with the rest of the webpage. Lastly, one of the users pointed out that the form looked half-done or default, as it utilized white and a dark color. This was also intentional, to have it look more professional than it’s playful background, although I don’t think it was received as well. Overall, the users interact correctly with the webpage, the main takeaway were certain aesthetic elements.</p>

            <h2>Update Based on the Feedback</h2>
            <p>I will update the webpage by altering the fonts to not only correspond better with each other, but to also correspond better with the rest of the webpage. This will allow for a much more cohesive webpage for the user to be greeted with. Furthermore, I also plan on beautify-ing the form element, I had liked how rudimentary it looked, but I don’t think it completely matches the rest of the page.</p>
