            <h2>Best Practices for Form Desgin</h2>
            <p>I realized something interesting about forms from the article, users dislike forms. Overall, the designer has to accommodate for the laziest users, making the form as easy and fast as possible in order to get them to fill it out. So many specifications and rules exist in order to successfully make a form simple for the user. I noticed how many different ways there are to fill out forms: from dropdown menus, numbers, and checkboxes. Everything is in effort to not overwhelm the user and to have the easiest possible process. There are almost too many ways to go wrong, as there are specific combinations that work. </p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows</h2>
            <p>Modals seem like an interesting solution to prompt the user to fill out a form. Although, based on this article it sounds like users hate modals and wish to close them immediately. This offers the interesting question of how to get users to interact or fill out a form if they hate modals and hate forms. It seems like it is a matter of designing the perfect and correct modal to intrigue and keep the user filling it out. For the design of the Mad Lib, modal usage is an adequate solution, although designing it to look more a part of the webpage, might make it less of an effort to fill out. The article didnâ€™t mention the aesthetics of a modal and it seems like many modals block the webpage. I think it might be interesting to see if I can make a modal that is more or just as intriguing as the webpage, to get the user to want to fill it out. </p>
