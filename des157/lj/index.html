            <h2>Best Practices for Form Desgin</h2>
            <p>I realized something interesting about forms from the article, users dislike forms. Overall, the designer has to accommodate for the laziest users, making the form as easy and fast as possible in order to get them to fill it out. So many specifications and rules exist in order to successfully make a form simple for the user. I noticed how many different ways there are to fill out forms: from dropdown menus, numbers, and checkboxes. Everything is in effort to not overwhelm the user and to have the easiest possible process. There are almost too many ways to go wrong, as there are specific combinations that work. </p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Modals/ Overlays/ Dialog Windows</h2>
            <p>Modals seem like an interesting solution to prompt the user to fill out a form. Although, based on this article it sounds like users hate modals and wish to close them immediately. This offers the interesting question of how to get users to interact or fill out a form if they hate modals and hate forms. It seems like it is a matter of designing the perfect and correct modal to intrigue and keep the user filling it out. For the design of the Mad Lib, modal usage is an adequate solution, although designing it to look more a part of the webpage, might make it less of an effort to fill out. The article didn’t mention the aesthetics of a modal and it seems like many modals block the webpage. I think it might be interesting to see if I can make a modal that is more or just as intriguing as the webpage, to get the user to want to fill it out. </p>

            <h2>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h2>
            <p>I think this was an important article to read, going forward with studio 2 especially. I thought it was interesting how they laid out the multitudes of ways to engage people with images, to make them look deeper into the meaning and context of an image. I think it’s critical to include these methods as a means to create a captivating piece, as well as a source of educating the user. A stand alone image may be interesting on it’s own, but by integrating these methods into studio 2, the image can become even more engaging. The tools can be applied to non-images I think as well, to other design elements to help keep the user engages to the website as well as to the image. </p>
            <p>The website I visited was by far one of the best websites I have been to. They used cards in order to represent images and held on to that extended metaphor throughout the whole website. Additionally, it felt like an engaging website because it wasn’t so static and felt closer to a game or real life. </p>
