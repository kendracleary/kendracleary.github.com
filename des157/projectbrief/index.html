            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p> A web page that gives daily predictions based on the information a user gives to it, predictions accompanied with a song, image and lucky number. </p>

            <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
            <p>Astrology.com provides a daily prediction based on your zodiac sign, it gives the overall prediction then proceeds to give a breakdown or more detail on said prediction. It also allows a user to look through other zodiac sign’s predictions as well as other days of the week. The website revolves around a darker interface and uses a lot of scroll interaction to navigate the website. Overall, I think the scrolling is unnecessary and the information could be better presented if it were more viewable on the same screen size. Additionally, the typeface and type size is not suitable, there is a hierarchy which is nice, but there should be a bigger difference and a font that better suits astrology. I do like that there is a possibility to “join” or become a member for frequent visitors. </p>

            <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>
            <p>Weather.com provides daily and hourly weather reports to give the user an idea on what the hour, day or month will look like, based on their location. I like this website and find that it does follow function more than anything. Although, on their home page there is an overwhelming amount of information, images and colors. This proves to be quite confusing, as to where to go if I would want a specific piece of information. It makes it almost difficult to find where I can actually see the weather and not some other information like weather elsewhere or news. I think this website tries to do too much and should consolidate information.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>My project will follow this same “prediction” model, but offer different things. It will have the survey on one screen and once filled out will present the prediction on another. This will offer a better flow than the previously seen comparison projects. This will also provide a cleaner and more concise interface. It will also offer a wider range of things, such as images, a lucky number, prediction and a song. So, in a way the design is more focused, but the offerings of the prediction are much less focused in comparison to the other projects. I think this will be much more of an artistic and creative endeavor than the other websites.</p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>The overall look and feel, will be like I previously said, it will be very artistic and creative. I am looking to create more of an art piece that is received through the medium of a web page rather than a web page that is more function or information based. I want to use a calm and cohesive color scheme, I think web design is over saturated with bright colors, that I wanted to calm it down in order to use more colors in the palette as well. The type used will be very robotic and sans serif to contrast the art and images on the page.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>Interactions will include the survey first and foremost as this is the most important. Most of the interactions and animations will be more of the “easter egg” form, allowing the user to explore the web page for themself. I want to have images and art behind the survey to move or change when the mouse hovers over it. This goes for the prediction as well, each element given as feedback will feature their own unique interaction and animation. The song will play when clicked, the lucky number will go through numbers until landing on the correct one, the prediction will quickly type itself out, etc.</p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal is for the user to experience a fun website that does deliver a small amount of information for their day. I want to help a user explore new music with the song, because each song will be specific to their responses that it can change. I really just want to have a happy, pick-me-up, joyous website to have a small effect on someone’s day. I want the website to be charming enough for users to want to visit back ideally on a daily basis, to see all the different predictions they can achieve. The overall design is for creativity and to put a smile on the user’s face.</p>
